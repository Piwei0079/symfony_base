Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

  Problem 1
    - lcobucci/jwt is locked to version 5.6.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - lcobucci/jwt 5.6.0 requires ext-sodium * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's sodium extension.
  Problem 2
    - symfony/mercure-bundle is locked to version v0.4.2 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - lcobucci/jwt 5.6.0 requires ext-sodium * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's sodium extension.
    - symfony/mercure-bundle v0.4.2 requires lcobucci/jwt ^3.4|^4.0|^5.0 -> satisfiable by lcobucci/jwt[5.6.0].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.4.0\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-sodium` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
